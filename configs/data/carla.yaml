# CARLA Object Detection
#
# Description: Vehicle and pedestrian bounding boxes gathered from CARLA
# Simulator
#
# Provenance: RGB Images caputered @640x480, 30fps in CARLA Sim 0.9.13 from
# town 10.  Bounding boxes were determined by finding the tightest box for a
# group of pixels from the same class using the CARLA segmentation camera as
# the ground truth.  Only vehicles and pedestrians are considered.
