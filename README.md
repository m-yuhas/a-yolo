# pl-YOLO
Detection on pytorch lightning.

YOLOX and YOLOv5 are working on my small dataset. Don't have time to tune them on COCO dataset.

For now I haven't time to write a readme. The code can be a reference of object detection based on pytorch lightning.

## Step of training
# 1. Change the dataset directory in configs.
# 2. Run
'''python
python train.py -c <absolute path of the config>
'''
